# BayMed
BayMed is an imaginary brand running a website that is used to sell drugs online :).

# How to host in XAMPP:
git clone entire project to /htdocs directory (by default settings in .htaccess). If you want to run it in other directory dont forget to change the path in index.php (router) and .htaccess.

Note: don't forget to enable gd extension[uncomment in php.ini] (it is used for generating image in captcha feature).

Have Fun :)
